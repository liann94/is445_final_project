IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

This class made me feel more confident in my coding abilities. I enjoyed learning about interactivity 
and applying it to my projects over the semester. Aside from the technical aspects of this class, I also 
enjoyed finding weekly data visualizations. It helped me become more aware of things I thought were helpful
or detrimental in terms of data storytelling and I hope to apply those things to my future projects.

I really enjoyed the shorter class lengths. This helped with my time management over the semester. I would 
have liked quicker response times on some of my help request emails. If unable to email back, perhaps a blanket 
email has been received auto response would help since I often worried my email hadn't sent for whatever
reason. That being said, the times I did office hours were extremely helpful. 

Thank you for a great semester.
