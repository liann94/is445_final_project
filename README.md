IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

This class made me feel more confident in my coding abilities. I enjoyed learning about interactivity 
and applying it to my projects over the semester. Aside from the technical aspects of this class, I also 
enjoyed finding weekly data visualizations. It helped me become more aware of things I thought were helpful
or detrimental in terms of data storytelling and I hope to apply those things to my future projects.

I really enjoyed the shorter class lengths. This helped with my time management over the semester. I would 
have liked quicker response times on some of my help request emails. I understand professors are busy, but
it was hard to reach for help in a timely fashion and most times, I ended up turning to Google and hoping for
the best.
